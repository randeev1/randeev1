<h2>About Me</h2>
<p> 
Hello everyone, my name is Randee. I am currently in my third year of college. I am aiming to get my degree in Computer Information Systems. I am currently 20 years old.
I have recently built my own PC so I have been excited to see how I can finally use a quicker device than my old computer. The only "interesting" thing about me is that I
mostly made my computer to run one of my favorite games quicker besides wanting a faster computer in general. I also started my first job back in October. Nice to meet all of you!
